 	1) Because we added the new quantity in the buyOrders1 page, the values can overflow and produce negative ints 
		* Fix by converting to long or float or double or w/e
		* FIXED FOR SUPER SALES BUT NOT FOR OLD SALES
			* DOES THAT PAGE MATTER FOR DEMO?
	
	2) 2 User problem
		* The run/refresh of a user must not impact the overall log table as to prevent run/refresh
	3) Improve PC tables, more JS/AJAX
